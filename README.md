# Array-Practice

Write three (3) for loop statements in the main that perform the following one-dimensional array operations on a 10-element integer array called a. That is,
const int size = 10;
int a[size];
1. In a for loop, populate each element to 5. Print the array.
2. In a for loop, populate each element with a random decimal from 1 to 100. Print the array.
3. In a for loop, set each element to sequential multiples of 5, that is {0, 5, 10, 15,...}. Print the array.
Write three (3) more for loop statements in the main. Declare another array to hold doubles called b:
const int n = 100;
double b[size];
4. In a for loop, populate this array b with the decimals {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8,...}. Print the array.
5. In a for loop, add all the numbers in array b.  Print the sum.
6. In a for loop, print the previous array b backwards.

Turn in one .cpp file with six (6) for loops in the main.
